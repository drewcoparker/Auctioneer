## Auctioneer

Auctioneer is a full-stack bidding site similar to Ebay. Not intended for public use (I would probably get sued for that), Auctioneer serves more as a proof of concept. It's built as a MERN stack application--in this case with MySql, Express, React with Redux, and Node.js. Users can browse and bid on various items other users have for sell or they can submit an item to sell themselves.
